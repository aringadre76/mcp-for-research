## 🔧 How to Test Right Now

### **Prerequisites Check**
1. **Context Bridge Running**:
   ```bash
   cd context-bridge
   python3 main.py
   # Should show: LocalLook Context Bridge started on 127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

2. **Frontend App Running**:
   ```bash
   # Start your React app (or any frontend)
   npm start  # Usually runs on localhost:3000
   ```

### **Test the Extension**

1. **Open Cursor IDE** in your frontend project

2. **Install Extension** (development mode):
   - Open the `cursor-extension` folder in a separate Cursor window
   - Press F5 to run in Extension Development Host
   - OR manually install the compiled extension

3. **Test Commands**:
   ```bash
   # In Cursor:
   Cmd+Shift+P → "LocalLook: Get Frontend Context"
   # Enter your frontend URL: http://localhost:3000
   # Should open a markdown document with rich context
   ```

4. **Try Autonomous Development**:
   ```bash
   # In Cursor:
   Cmd+Shift+P → "LocalLook: Start Autonomous Development"  
   # Enter goal: "Make this page responsive"
   # Should provide comprehensive context and instructions to Cursor AI
   ```

## 🎯 The Autonomous Development Flow

With Phase 2 complete, here's how autonomous development works:

### **1. Goal Setting**
```bash
User: "Make this landing page responsive and add a contact form"
```

### **2. Context Capture**
```bash
Extension → Context Bridge → Browser Automation
    ↓
Captures: DOM + Screenshot + Performance + Accessibility + Interactions
    ↓
Returns: Rich frontend context to Cursor AI
```

### **3. AI Analysis & Planning**
```bash
Cursor AI receives comprehensive context
    ↓
Analyzes current state vs goal
    ↓  
Plans necessary changes
    ↓
Begins implementation
```

### **4. Implementation & Testing**
```bash
Cursor AI modifies files
    ↓
Hot reload updates frontend
    ↓
Extension captures new state
    ↓
Tests changes automatically
    ↓
Continues until goal achieved
```
