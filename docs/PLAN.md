# Scholarly Research MCP Development Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & PubMed Integration
**Week 1-2: Core Setup**
- Set up MCP server structure with TypeScript
- Implement PubMed E-utilities API integration
- Create basic search and fetch functions
- Set up proper error handling and rate limiting

**Week 3: Data Processing**
- Parse PubMed XML responses into structured data
- Implement filtering (date, author, journal, etc.)
- Add citation count and impact factor data
- Create standardized paper object format

## Phase 2: JSTOR Integration
**Week 4-5: API Setup**
- Research JSTOR Data for Research API access
- Implement authentication and API calls
- Handle different response formats
- Add JSTOR-specific search parameters

**Week 6: Data Harmonization**
- Normalize data between PubMed and JSTOR
- Implement cross-source deduplication
- Create unified search interface

## Phase 3: Google Scholar Integration
**Week 7-8: Scraping Implementation**
- Build respectful scraping with proper delays
- Handle rate limiting and IP rotation
- Parse HTML responses into structured data
- Implement fallback mechanisms

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Week 9-10: Enhanced Functionality**
- Citation network analysis
- Author collaboration mapping
- Research trend analysis
- Export functionality (BibTeX, EndNote, etc.)

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing
**Week 11-12: Final Touches**
- MCP client integration
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and logging
- Documentation and examples

## Technical Architecture

**Core Components:**
1. **MCP Server**: Main entry point handling client requests
2. **Source Adapters**: Individual modules for each academic source
3. **Data Normalizer**: Standardizes data across sources
4. **Search Engine**: Coordinates multi-source searches
5. **Cache Layer**: Reduces API calls and improves performance

**Data Flow:**
```
Client Request → MCP Server → Search Engine → Source Adapters → Data Normalizer → Response
```

**Key Challenges to Address:**
- Rate limiting across all sources
- Data consistency between sources
- Error handling for network issues
- Legal compliance with ToS
- Performance optimization for large result sets

## Implementation Priority
1. Start with PubMed (easiest, most reliable)
2. Add JSTOR for broader coverage
3. Integrate Google Scholar for comprehensive results
4. Enhance with advanced analytics features
