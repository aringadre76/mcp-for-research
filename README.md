# 🤖 LocalLook - Autonomous AI Development Cycles

**Enable Cursor AI to autonomously develop frontend applications through continuous code-test-analyze-improve cycles.**

---

## 🌟 The Vision

**Current Reality**: AI can generate code, but it's blind to the actual running application.

**Our Solution**: AI that can:
1. **SEE** the running frontend (DOM structure, visual layout, interactions)  
2. **TEST** the application (click buttons, fill forms, navigate)
3. **ANALYZE** the results (detect bugs, UX issues, performance problems)
4. **CODE** improvements autonomously  
5. **REPEAT** the cycle until the goal is achieved

---

## 🎯 How It Works

```bash
# You give Cursor a goal:
"Make this landing page responsive and add a contact form"

# Cursor AI autonomously:
🧠 Analyzes current frontend state
💻 Writes React components and CSS  
🔄 Frontend updates via hot reload
👁️ Captures new state and tests interactions
📊 Evaluates progress toward goal
🔁 Repeats until perfect

# Result: Perfect, tested, responsive landing page with working contact form
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Cursor-Centric Design**: Instead of competing with Cursor's AI, we enhance it with frontend awareness.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Cursor IDE** with AI enabled
- **Python 3.11+** 
- **Node.js 16+**
- **Chrome/Chromium** browser

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd localook

# Install Context Bridge
cd context-bridge
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Cursor Extension  
cd ../cursor-extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start your React app
npm start  # localhost:3000

# 2. Start Context Bridge
cd context-bridge
python main.py

# 3. In Cursor IDE:
# Cmd+Shift+P → "LocalLook: Start Autonomous Development"
# Enter goal: "Make this page responsive"
# Watch AI code, test, and iterate autonomously!
```

## 🎯 Example Goals

Try these with your Cursor AI:

- **"Make this landing page responsive"**
- **"Add a contact form with validation"** 
- **"Implement dark mode toggle"**
- **"Fix the mobile navigation menu"**
- **"Improve accessibility compliance"**
- **"Add loading states to all buttons"**

---

## 🔧 Context Bridge API

The Context Bridge provides rich frontend context to Cursor AI:

```python
# POST /capture - Get current frontend state
{
  "url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "screenshot": "base64_image_data",
  "dom": {
    "elements": [...],
    "forms": [...], 
    "buttons": [...],
    "inputs": [...]
  },
  "performance": {
    "loadTime": 1200,
    "errors": []
  },
  "accessibility": {
    "score": 85,
    "issues": [...]
  }
}
```

## 🌈 The Autonomous Experience

**Traditional Development:**
1. Human writes code
2. Human tests manually
3. Human describes issues to AI
4. AI suggests fixes
5. Human implements fixes
6. Repeat...

**With LocalLook:**
1. Human sets goal
2. AI codes, tests, analyzes, and iterates
3. AI achieves goal autonomously  
4. Human reviews final result

**This isn't just faster - it's a completely different paradigm.**

---

## 🎊 Why This Changes Everything

- **Development Speed**: 5-10x faster for common tasks
- **Code Quality**: Consistent patterns and best practices  
- **Bug Detection**: Catch issues before human review
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance by default
- **Responsive Design**: Perfect across all devices
- **Performance**: Optimized Core Web Vitals
