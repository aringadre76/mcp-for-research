# AI Frontend Visual Feedback Bridge: Expansive Plan

## 1. **Project Overview**
- Build a system that allows AI coding assistants (via Cursor IDE) to "see" the live state of a developer's frontend running in the browser.
- Enable real-time, visual feedback and debugging by bridging the browser and IDE.
- Focus on a polished, seamless user experience with minimal setup.

---

## 2. **Core Components**

### A. **Browser Extension**
- Captures screenshots and DOM snapshots of the current page.
- Sends data to the Cursor extension via a secure, local channel (WebSocket or Native Messaging).
- UI: Button(s) for manual capture, optional auto-capture on changes.
- Handles permissions, privacy, and user consent.

### B. **Cursor Extension**
- Receives visual/DOM data from the browser extension.
- Provides this context to the AI agent for enhanced code suggestions and debugging.
- UI: Panel to view received screenshots/DOM, trigger captures, and review AI feedback.
- Handles communication, error reporting, and user settings.

### C. **Communication Bridge**
- Secure, local-only WebSocket server (or Native Messaging) for real-time, bidirectional data transfer.
- Handles authentication, session management, and error recovery.

---

## 3. **Key Features**
- One-click setup: minimal user configuration.
- Real-time or on-demand capture of browser state.
- Privacy-first: all data stays local unless user opts in to cloud features.
- Visual diffing: highlight changes between captures.
- AI-powered suggestions: use visual context for smarter code fixes.
- Error and edge case handling (e.g., multiple browsers, multiple projects).

## 4. **Technical Steps & Milestones**

### **Phase 1: MVP**
1. Create a basic browser extension that captures screenshots and DOM.
2. Build a simple Cursor extension that can receive and display this data.
3. Implement a local WebSocket server for communication.
4. Manual trigger: user clicks "Send to Cursor" in browser, data appears in Cursor panel.

### **Phase 2: Polished Integration**
1. Automate server startup/shutdown from Cursor extension.
2. Add authentication and session management for secure communication.
3. Implement real-time/auto-capture (on DOM changes, navigation, or hot reload).
4. Enhance UI/UX in both extensions (settings, feedback, error handling).
5. Add visual diffing and history in Cursor panel.

### **Phase 3: AI Feedback Loop**
1. Integrate with Cursor's AI agent, providing visual context for code suggestions.
2. Enable "fix this visual bug" and similar workflows.
3. Allow AI to request new captures or specific DOM elements.
4. Add support for multiple projects and browser tabs.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
1. Optional cloud relay for remote/collaborative workflows.
2. Accessibility and performance audits using AI.
3. User-configurable privacy filters (e.g., redact sensitive info).
4. Support for additional browsers and frameworks.

## 5. **Architecture Diagram**

- Browser Extension <-> Local WebSocket/Native Messaging <-> Cursor Extension <-> AI Agent

---

## 6. **Security & Privacy Considerations**
- Only allow local connections by default.
- Prompt user for permission before sending any data.
- Optionally redact or filter sensitive information.
- Clear error messages and troubleshooting steps.

---

## 7. **Development & Testing**
- Develop and test both extensions locally (no publishing required).
- Use mock data and automated tests for communication bridge.
- Gather user feedback early and iterate on UX.
